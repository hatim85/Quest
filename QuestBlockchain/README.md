# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

hatim@Hatims-MacBook-Air QuestBlockchain % npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network luksoTestnet

WARNING: You are currently using Node.js v23.11.0, which is not supported by Hardhat. This can lead to unexpected behavior. See https://hardhat.org/nodejs-versions
